You are working on an existing full-stack web application named Medi-Ops. Live version: https://medi-ops-revamp--hackanova.replit.app
 and design + UX reference (do NOT clone, only take inspiration): https://v0-medi-ops-saa-s-app-git-main2-aarushs-projects-43737ecd.vercel.app/
. CRITICAL RULES: DO NOT delete or break any existing features, DO NOT break authentication, login, or current database, extend the app, do not rewrite it from scratch, maintain current routing structure, maintain existing backend logic, reuse existing UI components where possible, make all additions modular, must remain deployable on Replit, no console errors, no broken links, no broken routes. Add a global light/dark mode toggle button fixed in the top-right corner that toggles the entire site including backgrounds, cards, text, navbars, modals, tables, and forms, persists using localStorage, respects system theme by default, has smooth transitions, is mobile-friendly, and is available on all pages. Add a “View Demo” button on the start/landing page that opens the dashboard without login, uses mock/sample data, runs in read-only mode, shows a visible “Demo Mode” banner, prevents real DB changes, and allows exiting demo mode. Add new tabs and database integration including an Inventory tab with fields product name, SKU/ID, category, stock quantity, expiry date, supplier, price, availability status, with add, edit, delete, search, filter, low-stock warnings, and its own database collection; an Orders tab split into Consumer Orders (order ID, consumer name, items, quantity, status: Pending, Packed, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled, priority based on subscription, timestamp) and Retail Shop Orders (shop name, order ID, bulk quantities, pricing tier, delivery ETA, status), both with full CRUD, filters, search, and their own DB structures; a Subscription Management tab with three plans—Basic (standard delivery, no priority, no consultation), Pro (faster delivery, limited consultation, medium priority), Premium (fastest delivery, unlimited doctor consultation, highest priority, emergency priority)—where users are linked to plans, plans affect order priority, emergency handling, and UI labels, admins can manage plans, users can view plan info, and everything uses a separate database; and an Emergency tab showing all emergency requests with fields emergency ID, consumer name, location, emergency type, description, timestamp, status (Pending, In Progress, Resolved), priority based on subscription, visually highlighted, sorted by urgency, with admin controls, and its own database. Make the entire site fully responsive so the sidebar becomes a hamburger on mobile, tables become card layouts, no horizontal scrolling exists, forms are stacked, buttons are thumb-friendly, modals are fullscreen, and the toggle and navbar remain accessible. Add personalization features including greeting users by name, role-based dashboards, subscription-based UI changes, personalized quick actions, recent activity, smart suggestions, and stored preferences. Improve UI/UX with a modern SaaS look, clean spacing, better typography, card-based layouts, subtle animations, improved contrast, clear hierarchy, better navigation clarity, icon usage, and smooth transitions, using the reference site only as inspiration. Implement demo data that loads only in demo mode for inventory, orders, subscriptions, and emergency requests and never affects the real database. Follow technical requirements: modular components, clean routing, optimized performance, lazy loading, no duplication, clean code, proper state management, reusable components, and comments where needed. Final output must include: light/dark mode, demo mode, inventory tab, orders tab (consumer + retail), subscription management, emergency tab, mobile responsiveness, personalized UI, no broken features, and no console errors. Before coding, analyze the existing codebase to identify current structure, current DB logic, routing system, and component system, then implement upgrades incrementally.
